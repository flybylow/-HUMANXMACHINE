    "longDescription": "# The Challenge\n\nElectrolux operates 30+ manufacturing sites globally, each with unique machine configurations. The existing systems were fragmented, leading to high training costs and operational inefficiencies.\n\n# The Solution\n\nWe created a comprehensive design system that balances standardization with necessary customization. The system includes:\n\n- Modular UI components that adapt to different machine types\n- A unified navigation pattern across all sites\n- Accessibility features for factory floor environments\n- Multi-language support with contextual help\n\n# The Impact\n\nThe new system reduced training time by 40% and improved operational efficiency across all sites.",
