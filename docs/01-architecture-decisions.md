# Architecture Decisions

## Key Learnings from Building the Human Machine Website

### 1. Why Next.js 14 App Router?

**Decision:** Use Next.js 14 with App Router instead of Pages Router

**Reasoning:**
- **Server Components by Default** - Better performance, smaller client bundles
- **File-based Routing** - Intuitive folder structure (`/app/interviews/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- **Layout System** - Shared layouts reduce code duplication
- **Static Generation** - All pages pre-rendered at build time for maximum speed
- **SEO Optimized** - Built-in metadata API for search engines

**What We Learned:**
- App Router is more intuitive for organizing content-heavy sites
- `generateStaticParams()` makes dynamic routes statically generated
- Layouts cascade down, reducing boilerplate
- TypeScript integration is seamless

### 2. Why JSON for Content?

**Decision:** Store all content in JSON files instead of a CMS or database

**Reasoning:**
- **Simplicity** - No database setup, no API endpoints
- **Version Control** - Content changes tracked in git
- **Type Safety** - TypeScript interfaces ensure data consistency
- **Fast Builds** - Static data means fast static site generation
- **Easy Editing** - Non-technical users can edit JSON on GitHub

**What We Learned:**
- JSON is perfect for portfolios, blogs, and small content sites
- Separating data from presentation is powerful
- You can always migrate to a CMS later if needed
- Sample data in JSON makes development faster

**Trade-offs:**
- Not suitable for frequently updated content
- No real-time updates (requires rebuild)
- Editing JSON directly can be error-prone (solution: use a JSON validator)

### 3. Why Tailwind CSS?

**Decision:** Use Tailwind CSS instead of CSS Modules or styled-components

**Reasoning:**
- **Utility-First** - Faster development, less context switching
- **Design System Built-in** - Custom colors and gradients in config
- **No Naming Decisions** - No need to name CSS classes
- **Tree-shaking** - Only used styles in production bundle
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first with breakpoint prefixes

**What We Learned:**
- Custom theme in `tailwind.config.ts` creates consistency
- Gradient utilities (`bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-pink-500`) are incredibly powerful
- JIT compiler makes custom values easy (`h-[450px]`)
- Works beautifully with TypeScript

**Best Practices:**
```typescript
// Define custom colors in config
colors: {
  cosmic: {
    navy: '#1e293b',
    blue: '#1e40af',
  }
}

// Use semantic color names
className="bg-cosmic-navy text-brand-orange"
```

### 4. Component Organization

**Decision:** Organize components by feature/section

**Structure:**
```
/components
  /home       - Home page specific
  /interviews - Interview specific
  /work       - Work specific
  /play       - Play specific
  /layout     - Navigation, Footer
  /shared     - Reusable across sections
```

**What We Learned:**
- Feature-based folders scale better than type-based (`/buttons`, `/cards`)
- Shared components should be truly generic
- Colocation (components near where they're used) improves maintainability
- Each section has its own Card and Grid components for flexibility

### 5. TypeScript Everywhere

**Decision:** Full TypeScript with strict mode

**What We Learned:**
- Type interfaces in `/data/types.ts` catch errors early
- `Interview`, `Work`, `Play` types ensure data consistency
- JSON data can be typed with assertions
- Props interfaces make components self-documenting

**Example:**
```typescript
// data/types.ts
export interface Interview {
  id: string;
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  // ... more fields
}

// Component
interface InterviewCardProps {
  interview: Interview;
}
```

### 6. Static Site Generation Strategy

**Decision:** Pre-render all pages at build time

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Generate static params for dynamic routes
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  return interviews.map((interview) => ({
    slug: interview.slug,
  }));
}
```

**What We Learned:**
- `generateStaticParams` is crucial for dynamic routes
- All data fetching happens at build time
- Results in ultra-fast page loads
- Perfect for content that doesn't change frequently

### 7. Image Strategy

**Decision:** Use placeholder gradients for now, real images later

**Reasoning:**
- Allows development without waiting for images
- Shows visual structure immediately
- Easy to replace with real images later
- Gradients maintain the cosmic theme

**What We Learned:**
- Next.js Image component would be ideal for production
- For static export, use `unoptimized: true`
- Image optimization is a game-changer for performance

### 8. Mobile-First Responsive Design

**Decision:** Design for mobile first, enhance for desktop

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Mobile by default
className="grid gap-8"

// Desktop enhancement
className="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-8"
```

**What We Learned:**
- Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`md:`, `lg:`) make this natural
- Most traffic is mobile, so prioritize that experience
- Desktop layouts are enhancements, not the baseline
- Test on real devices early

### 9. Animation Philosophy

**Decision:** Subtle animations, not overwhelming

**Examples:**
- Animated stars: `animate-pulse` with random delays
- Hover effects: `transition-all` with `hover:` states
- Button interactions: `group-hover:translate-x-1`

**What We Learned:**
- CSS transitions are sufficient for most use cases
- Framer Motion is available but not needed yet
- Animation delays create organic feel
- Performance matters - use GPU-accelerated properties

### 10. SEO and Metadata

**Decision:** Use Next.js built-in Metadata API

**Implementation:**
```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Page Title',
  description: 'Description',
  openGraph: { ... }
};
```

**What We Learned:**
- Metadata API is cleaner than manual meta tags
- Each page should have unique metadata
- OpenGraph tags crucial for social sharing
- Dynamic metadata based on content works great

## Architectural Patterns That Worked

### 1. Component Composition
```typescript
<LatestSection 
  title="Latest Conversations"
  items={latestInterviews}
  viewAllLink="/interviews"
  type="interviews"
/>
```
- Reusable section component
- Type-safe props
- Flexible enough for different content types

### 2. Data-Driven Rendering
```typescript
interviews.map(interview => (
  <InterviewCard key={interview.id} interview={interview} />
))
```
- Map over JSON data
- Components receive typed objects
- Easy to add/remove content

### 3. Gradient Abstraction
```typescript
<div className={`bg-gradient-to-r ${interview.categoryGradient}`}>
```
- Store gradient classes in data
- Reuse across components
- Consistent brand colors

### 4. Responsive Grids
```typescript
className="grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8"
```
- Mobile: 1 column
- Tablet: 2 columns
- Desktop: 3 columns
- Consistent gap spacing

## What Would We Do Differently?

### 1. Image Management
- Use a CDN for images
- Implement Next.js Image component earlier
- Consider image optimization service

### 2. Content Validation
- Add JSON schema validation
- Create content editing UI
- Implement preview mode

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Add analytics early
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Track user behavior

### 4. Testing
- Add component tests (React Testing Library)
- E2E tests for critical paths (Playwright)
- Visual regression tests
